# Placeholder for now
# Create functions that have to do with evidence
# Follow templates in users.py and auth.py
# Some Ideas:
# submit_evidence
# create_decision (admin deciding to approve or not)
# list_pending_evidence (list evidence that is awaiting admin approval)
# get_evidence_decisions



#Return Boolean? : Approve -> True, Disapprove -> False
def create_decision():
    

#Does it need to required login? perhaps the route URL of page that contain submit button, already validate it?
def submit_evidence(some_param):
    pass

def list_pending_evidnce():
    pass
#Something to do with fetching database
def get_evidence_decision():
    pass
